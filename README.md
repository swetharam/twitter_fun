# twitter_fun
This repository has many fun things that can be done with twitter api.
Firstly, the twitter-bot.py program is an automation bot that can do a bunch of really cool things.

This is what my twitter feed looks like after I ran the code for the #datascience tag. I made the program sleep for some time, as it is recommended to do so.
